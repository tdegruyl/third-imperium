# **Liv’s GURPS Traveller game**

## **Character Creation**

### **Concept**

An episodic romp through the Spinward Marches in a tramp freighter. Honestly, anything can happen.

### **Guidelines**

* Characters should be made in consultation with the GM  
* Points: 200 points total/up to \-50 in disadvantages (including up to \-5 in quirks)  
* Traits marked as **Exotic** or **Supernatural** which have not been acquired from a racial template require a significant rationale that fits the game milieu. Please chat with Liv.  
* Character Creation:  
  * 100-point main role template (Pilot, Comms and Nav Officer, or Engineer)  
  * One 50-point background lens  
  * A racial template (up to 55 points)  
  * Round out advantages, disadvantages, and skills  
  * Up to \-5 in personal quirks (i.e., do not count racial quirks)   
* **Tech Level**: 11 (using Safe-tech parameters, see UT10)  
  * No Neural interfaces and cybernetics, except for bionics intended to replace missing body parts.  
  * No genetic engineering, molecular nanotechnology, swarmbots, or volitional AI.  
* **Allowable Wealth**: Average or Comfortable.  
  * Wealth (Average) \[0\]: starting *available* wealth $15,000[^1]  
  * Wealth (Comfortable) \[10\]: starting *available* wealth $30,000  
* **Cost of Living** for the whole gang: $32,000/month in loan repayment, insurance, maintenance, and cost of living for the PCs.   
* **Income**: We will use the rules below to abstract freight and passenger revenue.

### **Background**

For this campaign, PCs should be one of the following:

* Human (mixed human, Darrian, Nexxie, Solomani, or Vilani)  
* Aslan  
* Vargr

The Imperial year is 1120 (which translates to 5638 CE).  
The setting is the backwaters of the Spinward Marches.

### **Background Templates:**

These templates flesh out a character, as they are informed by the character’s past.

### **Professional Templates:**

There are three main templates: pilot, comm and nav officer, and engineer. Because this is a campaign about a tramp freighter, these are the choices and you’re probably going to want a character with each of these skill sets on the ship.

### **Required traits:**

* Cultural Familiarity (Third Imperium)  
* Language: Galanglic (Spoken)

### **Psionics**

Use GURPS Psionic Powers for psi powers, also requiring one of  

* Unusual Background (Latent Psionics) \[5\] (cannot start with any points in psionic skills)  
* Unusual Background (Psionic Institute Training) \[10\]

### **Cultural Traits**

#### *Cultural Familiarities Available for Starting Characters*

* Aslan  
* Darrian  
* Droyne  
* **Third Imperium[^2]**  
* K’kree  
* Vargr

#### *Languages Available for Starting Characters*

## **Ship**

The PCs need a ship. Specifically a Silk Road-class Far Trader. 

* All PCs are assumed to be involved in an ownership as equal partners and should have the following traits as a campaign switch:  
  * Ship Owner (Partnership, *ship name*) \[0\]  
* It is assumed that the ship is 20% owned by the PCs and 80% financed, and that the PCs are paying for it out of their income as shown above. Paying less than the cost of living shown per month above will *eventually* result in complications.  
* The ship is 72 years old, having been built in 1048\. Purchase price was M$4.1, new price was M$20.4.
