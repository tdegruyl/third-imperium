# **Liv’s GURPS Traveller game**

## 

## **Character Creation**

### **Concept**

An episodic, low-combat, roleplay-heavy sci-fi romp through the (Traveller) Spinward Marches in a tramp freighter. Honestly, anything can happen.

### **Guidelines**

* Characters should be made in consultation with the GM  
* Points: 200 points total/up to \-50 in disadvantages (including up to \-5 in quirks)  
* Traits marked as **Exotic** or **Supernatural** which have not been acquired from a racial template require a significant rationale that fits the game milieu. Please chat with Liv.  
* Character Creation:  
  * 100-point main role template (Pilot, Comms and Nav Officer, or Engineer)  
  * One 50-point background lens  
  * A racial template (up to 55 points)  
  * Round out advantages, disadvantages, and skills  
  * Up to \-5 in personal quirks (i.e., do not count racial quirks)   
* **Tech Level**: 11 (using Safe-tech parameters, see UT10)  
  * No Neural interfaces and cybernetics, except for bionics intended to replace missing body parts with a technological equivalent.  
  * No genetic engineering, molecular nanotechnology, swarmbots, or volitional AI.  
* **Allowable Wealth**: The allowed wealth levels are *Struggling, Average,* or *Comfortable*. We will be using the concept of schrödinger’s luggage, where each character can have a certain amount of useful adventuring gear (‘stuff’) onboard that will be determined later (via skill rolls).  
  * **Wealth (Struggling) \[-10\]**: starting *available* wealth $2,500[^1], plus up to $5,000/500 lbs in ‘stuff’  
  * **Wealth (Average) \[0\]**: starting *available* wealth $5,000, plus up to $10,000/1,000 lbs of ‘stuff’  
  * **Wealth (Comfortable) \[10\]:** starting *available* wealth $10,000, plus $20,000/2,000 lbs of ‘stuff’   
* **Cost of Living** for the whole gang: $32,000/month in loan repayment, insurance, maintenance, and cost of living for the PCs.   
* **Income**: We will use the rules below to abstract freight and passenger revenue.

### **Background**

The Imperial year is 1120 (which translates to 5638 CE).

The setting is the backwaters of the Spinward Marches. The Fifth Frontier War (between the Zhodani and the Imperium) ended 10 years ago.

### **PC Species/Subspecies**

For this campaign, because of the starting location and the social and physical demands of various interstellar species, PCs should be one of the following:

* Human (mixed human, Darrian, Nexxie, Solomani, or Vilani)  
* Aslan  
* Vargr

### **Equipment and Technology Notes**

*I don’t expect this to be a combat-focused game*, but space is a dangerous place and a pistol or rifle slugthrower may be nice to have (along with points in the appropriate Guns skill). 

The technology in the Traveller universe is informed by a particular view of tech from 1977, so some things don’t make sense from a modern standpoint. Just assume that things worked out a little different from real life in the history of this game universe. For example, Laser and Plasma guns in the Traveller universe use cumbersome backpack power units, which makes them less useful on a day-to-day basis. 

Some equipment choices make sense for in-universe reasons. Robots are not common and true AI does not exist within the Imperium because of fear of technology and a reliance on inexpensive human labor. Psionic powers are terrifying to the Imperium due to the wars with the Zhodani Consulate. Psionic blocking tech is built-in for all helmets, vehicles, and buildings as a matter of course. 

A final note on equipment from a gaming standpoint: some choices are made for narrative reasons, rather than verisimilitude. For example, drone operation is an excellent choice in many real life situations, but the lack of inherent danger and narrative tension, as well as the process of splitting the party, makes it unappealing from a gaming standpoint.

### **Background Templates**

These templates flesh out a character, as they are informed by the character’s past.

### **Professional Templates**

There are three main templates: pilot, comm and nav officer, and engineer. Because this is a campaign about a tramp freighter, these are the choices and you’re probably going to want a character with each of these skill sets on the ship.

### **Psionics**

Use GURPS Psionic Powers for psi powers, also requiring one of  

* Unusual Background (Latent Psionics) \[5\] (cannot start with any points in psionic skills)  
* Unusual Background (Psionic Institute Training) \[10\]

### **Cultural Traits**

#### *Cultural Familiarities Available for Starting Characters*

* Aslan  
* Darrian  
* Droyne  
* **Third Imperium[^2]**  
* K’kree  
* Vargr

#### *Languages Available for Starting Characters*

* **Galanglic[^3]**  
* Aslan  
* Darrian  
* Droyne  
* K’kree  
* Vargr  
* Vilani

## **Ship**

The PCs need a ship. Specifically a Silk Road-class Far Trader. 

* All PCs are assumed to be involved in an ownership as equal partners and should have the following traits as a campaign switch:  
  * Ship Owner (Partnership, *ship name*) \[0\]  
* It is assumed that the ship is 20% owned by the PCs and 80% financed, and that the PCs are paying for it out of their income as shown above. Paying less than the cost of living shown per month above will *eventually* result in complications.  
* The ship is 72 years old, having been built in 1048\. Purchase price was M$4.1, new price was M$20.4.
